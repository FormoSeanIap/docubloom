# Document Collaboration

## Collaborator Management Rules
---
- There are owner, editor, and viewer roles in DocuBloom. Collaborator management depends on these three roles. Just give it a try on the site if you don't want to read these complicated rules XD.
1. You will be the owner right after creating a new document.
2. An owner can change others' role to an owner, editor, or viewer.
3. An owner can see other collaborators of the document.
4. An owner can remove any collaborator instead of another owner.
5. An owner can remove, edit, and view the document.
6. An owner cannot leave a document or be removed by others.
7. A document must have at least one owner.
8. An editor can change others' role to an editor, or viewer.
9. An editor can see other collaborators of the document.
10. An editor can edit and view the document.
11. An editor can leave the document.
12. A viewer can view the document.
13. A viewer can leave the document.
14. A viewer can see other collaborators of the document.
- If you are the owner of a document and you want to remove another owner. You will need to change his role to an editor or view, and then remove him.
- If you are the owner of a document and you want to leave this document. You need make sure there is at least another one as an owner, change your own role to an editor or viewer, and then click the leave document button.
